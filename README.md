# Hash Map Implementation

Hash map implementation in Python.  This program uses a dynamic array to store a hash table and resolves collision by chaining (hash_map_chaining.py) and
open addressing (hash_map_open_addressing).  Linked list is used in hash_map_chaining.py and dynamic array with quadratic probing is used in hash_map_open_addressing.
